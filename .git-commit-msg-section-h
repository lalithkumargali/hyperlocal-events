feat(rank): multi-factor scoring + tests

Implement transparent multi-factor ranking algorithm with Jaccard similarity, distance scoring, time-fit with sigmoid, and comprehensive unit tests.

Scoring Algorithm:
score = 0.4*interest + 0.3*distance + 0.2*timeFit + 0.1*popularity

1. Interest Score (40% weight):
   - Jaccard similarity: |intersection| / |union|
   - Compares user interests with event categories
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - Returns 0.5 (neutral) if no interests specified
   - Example: interests=[music, rock], categories=[music, jazz, live]
     → intersection={music}, union={music, rock, jazz, live}
     → Jaccard = 1/4 = 0.25

2. Distance Score (30% weight):
   - Formula: max(0, 1 - (distanceMeters / radiusMeters))
   - Linear decay with distance
   - 0m = 1.0 (perfect), radiusMeters = 0.0 (edge)
   - Simple and predictable scoring

3. Time-Fit Score (20% weight):
   - Returns 1.0 if duration ≤ minutesAvailable
   - Sigmoid drop-off if duration > minutesAvailable
   - Formula: 1 / (1 + e^(normalizedExcess * 4))
   - Smooth degradation for longer events
   - Example: 180min event, 120min available
     → excess=60, normalized=0.5, sigmoid≈0.12

4. Popularity Score (10% weight):
   - Normalized provider popularity (0-1)
   - From provider-specific metrics
   - Lowest weight to avoid over-weighting popularity

Features:
- Transparent scoring with breakdown
- Deterministic results with same inputs
- Handles edge cases (missing venues, empty interests)
- Sorts results by score descending
- All scores normalized to 0-1 range

Unit Tests (9 tests):
1. Perfect interest match (Jaccard = 1.0)
2. Partial interest match (Jaccard = 0.25)
3. Distance score accuracy (~0.889 for 1.1km)
4. Sigmoid drop for time-fit (duration > available)
5. Time-fit = 1.0 when duration fits
6. Correct weight application (0.4+0.3+0.2+0.1)
7. Descending sort by score
8. Handles events without venues
9. Handles empty interests (neutral 0.5)

Test Results:
- 21/21 tests passed
- 9 rank.score tests
- 12 provider tests (from Section F)
- All deterministic with fixtures
- Scores properly sorted descending

Changes:
- Updated rank.score implementation
- Replaced simple relevance with Jaccard similarity
- Replaced proximity with distance formula
- Replaced complex time-fit with sigmoid
- Updated weights to specified values
- Added comprehensive unit tests

Mathematical Properties:
- Jaccard similarity: symmetric, bounded [0,1]
- Distance score: linear, bounded [0,1]
- Sigmoid: smooth, monotonic, bounded (0,1)
- Final score: weighted sum, bounded [0,1]

Acceptance: ✅ Tests green; scores sorted desc
Test command: pnpm --filter mcp-server test
Result: 21/21 tests passed
