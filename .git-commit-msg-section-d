feat(api): /health and /v1/suggest with OpenAPI

Implement minimal REST API with OpenAPI documentation and Zod validation.

Endpoints:
- GET /health → {ok: true}
  Health check endpoint with database and Redis connectivity check

- POST /v1/suggest → Suggestion[]
  Personalized event/place suggestions based on location, time, and interests
  Input: lat, lon, minutesAvailable, interests?, radiusMeters?, now?
  Output: Array of suggestions with venue, distance, duration, score
  
- GET /openapi.json → OpenAPI 3.1 spec
  Complete API documentation with request/response schemas

Features:
- Zod validation for all request bodies
- Comprehensive error handling (400 for validation, 502 for MCP failures)
- Deterministic mock suggestions (3 events/places from SF)
- OpenAPI 3.1 specification with examples
- Ready for MCP server integration in Section E

Mock Suggestions:
- Summer Music Festival (Golden Gate Park, score: 0.95)
- Tech Innovation Summit 2025 (Tech Hub, score: 0.88)
- The Grand Theater (place, score: 0.72)

Filtering:
- By distance (radiusMeters)
- By available time (minutesAvailable)
- By interests (future: will use event categories)
- Sorted by score (descending)

Validation:
- lat: -90 to 90
- lon: -180 to 180  
- minutesAvailable: 15 to 360
- radiusMeters: positive integer (default: 5000)
- now: ISO 8601 datetime (optional)

Acceptance: ✅ curl -X POST :4000/v1/suggest returns deterministic mock suggestions
Test script: ./test-api.sh
