feat(mcp): provider connectors with unified shape + tests

Implement 4 provider connectors with unified event shape, rate limiting, and comprehensive tests.

Providers:
1. Eventbrite - OAuth token authentication
   - Rate limit: 1000 requests/hour (~0.28/sec)
   - Events with venues, categories, capacity
   - Popularity based on capacity, online status, series

2. Ticketmaster - API key authentication
   - Rate limit: 5000 requests/day (~0.06/sec)
   - Events with classifications, genres, venues
   - Popularity based on images, prices, promoter

3. Meetup - Bearer token authentication
   - Rate limit: 200 requests/hour (~0.055/sec)
   - Meetups with groups, topics, venues
   - Popularity based on RSVPs, waitlist, featured status

4. Google Places - API key authentication (POIs)
   - Rate limit: Conservative (1/sec)
   - POI types: museums, parks, galleries, stadiums, etc.
   - Popularity based on ratings, reviews, open status

Unified Event Shape:
- provider: enum (eventbrite|ticketmaster|meetup|google-places)
- providerId: string (provider's unique ID)
- title: string
- description?: string
- category: string[] (normalized categories)
- startAt?: string (ISO 8601)
- endAt?: string (ISO 8601)
- venue: { name?, lat, lon, address? }
- url?: string
- popularity?: number (0-1 scale)

Rate Limiting:
- Token bucket algorithm per provider
- Configurable max tokens and refill rate
- Automatic refill based on elapsed time
- Prevents API quota exhaustion
- Respects provider-specific limits

Testing:
- 12 unit tests (3 per provider)
- Fixture-based testing (no network calls)
- Tests work without API keys (uses fixtures)
- Tests with keys mock axios responses
- 100% test pass rate

Features:
- Environment variable configuration
- Graceful fallback when keys not configured
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging with Pino
- TypeScript strict typing
- Zod validation for unified shape

Files Created:
- src/providers/types.ts - Unified types and interfaces
- src/providers/eventbrite.ts - Eventbrite connector
- src/providers/ticketmaster.ts - Ticketmaster connector
- src/providers/meetup.ts - Meetup connector
- src/providers/google-places.ts - Google Places connector
- src/lib/rate-limiter.ts - Token bucket rate limiter
- src/providers/__fixtures__/*.json - Test fixtures
- src/providers/*.test.ts - Unit tests

Environment Variables:
- EVENTBRITE_TOKEN - Eventbrite OAuth token
- TICKETMASTER_KEY - Ticketmaster API key
- MEETUP_KEY - Meetup API key
- GOOGLE_PLACES_KEY - Google Places API key

Acceptance: âœ… pnpm test passes; with keys absent, tests use fixtures
Test command: pnpm --filter mcp-server test
Result: 12/12 tests passed
